This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

blogs <- scan("en_US.blogs.txt", character(0), sep = "\n")
twitter <- scan("en_US.twitter.txt", character(0), sep = "\n")
news <- scan("en_US.news.txt", character(0), sep = "\n")

set.seed(8346)
library(caret)

randomTweets <- sample(1:length(twitter), 5000, replace = FALSE)
tweetSample <- twitter[randomTweets]
randomBlogs <- sample(1:length(blogs), 5000, replace = FALSE)
blogSample <- twitter[randomBlogs]
randomNews <- sample(1:length(news), 5000, replace = FALSE)
newsSample <- news[randomNews]


```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
